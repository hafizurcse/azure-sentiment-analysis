"I've read comments watch film looking stirring Shakespearian dialogue. This true, unfortunately, stirring dialogue, wonderful play contains, cut, replaced songs. I've read play, recently lucky enough see performed, remains one favourite Shakespearian Comedies, movie seems take I like away. The Princess, though doubt directed do, regal bearing, girls seemed lose cleverness characters - also affected unwise cuts, took away female characters already sparse dialogue, took comments context - little unnerving hear Princess proclaim; ""We wise girls mock lovers so!"", mocking taken place all. The news reels throughout film also disrupted flow, took away many excellent scenes, showed information scenes them, modern phrasing. In conclusion, excellent play, ruined odd concept, unwise cuts. Kenneth, I usually love do. What thinking?",0
"I happened borrow movie friend knowing nothing it, turned outstanding documentary journey ancient vessel across vast expanses ocean. Thor Heyerdahl developed theory ancient Incas Peru managed travel thousands miles across ocean Polynesia, based certain relics found places, certain types ancient sea-going vessels know available, analysis ocean wind currents, knowledge Incas did, fact, travel undetermined amount sea. In order test hypothesis, Heyerdahl crew construct vessel closely possible ancient Incas available, using balsa wood materials available time, set Lima, Peru's capital, try reach islands Polynesia, 5,000 miles away. His theory, like much ancient history, impossible prove 100% certainty, coverage journey provides strong support right. The film really little narration footage taken 100+ day expedition, detailed description like trials tribulations faced. I often wish Academy Award winning documentaries easier find, one 50 years ago still interesting informative I sure first released.",1

"I love music Clash I love music Joe Strummer The Mescaleros. I went movie hoping learn man behind that. But I came theatre knowing much Joe I already reading entry Wikipedia. The movie never really gets person, thoughts feelings. What collect little material had, shaky blurry videos interview people Joe Strummer camp fire. It turns people knew little all, director wanted movie order celebrities say, ""Oh, inspiration us"". Like Bono Johnny Depp (whom seemingly asked keep pirate costume benefit current success Pirates Caribbean). It seems director could even wait body cold jumped sell version ""the greatest punk rocker hippie heart"" ever lived, sanctifying person without really knowing enough him. Sure, fan enjoyed seeing images band, hearing anecdotes behind songs such, end I felt like remained portrait Joe Strummer could easily told 60-90 minutes.

"I really enjoyed movie. The humor bit absent times I enjoyed story moved dramatic serious throughout film. This second movie I saw Verdone acting (the 'Un sacco bello'), I see Italians find tiresome, think played role well loving father. My one drawback movie I knew took place Italy - somewhere center south, I presume, I felt like representation place. This movie could taken place New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Dehli...I always think important movies place give viewers something relate to. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If like Italian films, I think enjoy this. It's Fellini Rossellini - realism neo-realism. It's comical story serious moments could really happen us.",1

"Currently, film listed IMDb 42nd worst film ever made--which exactly I rented NetFlix. However, I saddened report film, bad, near bad enough merit bottom 100 films ever made list. I personally seen least 100 films worse one. Hardly glowing endorsement, meet expected level awfulness included infamous list. The film begin Stewart Moss Marianne McAndrew belated honeymoon (by way, married real life well). He's doctor obsessed bats insists go nearby cave. Once there, behave very, very, stupidly (hallmark bad film) soon bitten bat. According film, bats love attack people vampire bats US--both true all. Oddly, bitten, man even bother going hospital!! The first thing anyone's mind (especially doctor) get medical help immediately, boob. Soon, he's seizures--yet STILL interested seeking help! Again keep thinking must stupidest couple film history!!  After while, eventually goes see doctor sent hospital. But, late attacks become violent begins killing people suck blood. When totally obvious everyone man crazed killing machine, wife (who, like husband, grapefruit brain) refuses believe he's dangerous--even attacks people, steals ambulance runs police car road!!  Now time Moss going episodes, eyes roll back looks like normal person. Oddly, however, couple times develops bat-like hands towards end used nice prosthetics make look quite bat-like. Had really cheesy, film would merited 1. In end, twist hardly made sense all, wife inexplicably turned crazed bat lady swarm bats kill evil sheriff. How arranged mystery Moss' McAndrew's belief film would somehow help careers--though reasonably long careers TV playing bit roles since 1974. Overall, dumb. The plot silly makes sense strongly relies people acting way dumb real. Not good film all, among worst films time either. NOTE: For reason, IMDb shows graphic three DVD set IT'S ALIVE two sequels web page THE BAT PEOPLE. While THE BAT PEOPLE seen title ""It's Alive"", two movies related. It's easy understand mistake--especially since came 1974, movie I reviewed starred Stewart Moss Marianne McAndrew film starred John Ryan Sharon Farrell.",0
"This movie much like ""Flashdance"", know dance flick Jennifer Beals. That film probably boring film I ever seen since even bad enough funny. ""G.I. Jane"" much better film, say much. Here Demi Moore sweats lot there's high music get see fight everything, certainly engaging. I really think idea behind film kind interesting, script clich├⌐d Ridley Scott can't anything that. Well, like I said... It's better ""Flashdance""... (4/10)",0
This film good characters excellent performances cast. David Strathairn diabolically sincere child molesting salesman Danny Vinson plays perfect pussy-whipped southern husband. The slick soundtrack betrays murder ballad tone film.,1

"The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon best role ever), newest spy kid block, brings quest identity close also seeks end CIA's latest program ""Blackbriar"" make super assassins like himself. I psyched one I watched predecessors yesterday today. Identity brilliant I recall Supremacy remains weak (but still enjoyable) link chain weakest plot and, aside car chase film's chase easily tops, slight lacking action suspense. Hoo boy, Ultimatum suspense! Even know Bourne escape authorities (and boy films spotlight police inept), still brilliant watching it. It's mind-boggling think two guys handguns mopeds create 10x suspense anything $150 million giant robots Transformers. Chalk Paul Greengrass, idiosyncratic style shooting stedicam la documentary, even though he's filming characters far ordinary, places like CIA headquarters one within 10 miles would allowed camcorder. He seemed listen various complaints Supremacy, action Ultimatum nothing less awe-inspiring, various implements used weapons candlestick, hardcover book (I'll never look way again) electric fan (Don't ask). The music also helped generate much suspense, hardly ever moment nail-bite over. The acting good, evolution Julia Stiles' character ""Nicky"" put situation new highly sympathetic light. Damon plays signature role reserve competency (which sounds minor genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade CIA Interpol something), noticeable moments poignancy still struggles find humanity. This longing real life could get boring, almost Supremacy, works better Ultimatum (better script).  I reminded scene ""Goldeneye"" (the good Pierce Brosnan Bond film) Sean Bean's character asks James martinis ever silence screams men he's killed. Bourne regrets people killed, considers (or least made consider) meaning action without purpose, life without meaning, government transformed men resources. Albeit, resources know Krav Maga make weapons anything. Sidenote: always bothered that, despite superspy hunted CIA, Interpol, police nearly ANYWHERE goes, Bourne never thought make even smallest attempts disguise features forge new passports. Sunglasses maybe?  If pulse love action movies, Bourne Ultimatum you. Hell, probably best action film come year. Of course, fool see without watching others first. It kind drags touch near end, I almost feel tempted overlook that. This first ""3"" movie summer least match, exceed, original saying something. A-",1

"While movie's style understated realistic sound version probably would been, still good film. In fact, seen excellent film day, nominated first Best Picture Oscar (losing WINGS). I still consider WINGS superior film, one excellent despite little bit overacting lead, Emil Jannings. Jannings general Czarist Russia living final days making bucks 1920s Hollywood extra. His luck appears changed gets casting call--to play Imperial Russian general fighting Communists revolution. Naturally much stretch acting-wise, also gets old man thinking old days revolution.

"Terrible film made budget $9.99. Very obvious miniature sets used, poor acting awful storyline concerning aliens use discarded meat butcher shop fuel spaceship. The film contains blood (not enough disturb) character eggbeater replacing one hands. (Yes read correctly.) One saving grace song performed ""talent show"" (how's irony?) punk/new wave band I think called ""I'm A Heat Seeking Missile"". Other that, worth time, even ""so bad good"" level.

"Military training films becoming common becoming genre unto themselves. Among prominent have, `Officer Gentleman', `Top Gun', `GI Jane', `Men Honor'. The fact one happened true change fact formula same. This film probably like `GI Jane' since focuses desegregation angle. The story actually quite inspirational probably best human-interest story among mentioned above. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) unquestionably man great courage principle, strength character shines brightly film. Unfortunately, director George Tillman tunnel vision presenting characters eschews character development various characters Brashear favor showing Brashear constant state adversity. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) central figure, except initial scene, fistfight couple scenes wife, know much him. For instance, Brashear sees scars Sunday's palms assume worked plow, follow-up point. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets one short scene judge him. The rest screen time shows pacing around ranting. If director going make human-interest story, needs humanize characters. Cuba Gooding Jr. gives outstanding performance Brashear. This probably best I've seen him. This role character far complete part played before, rises occasion. In `Jerry Maguire', Rod Tidwell fascinating, one-dimensional character depth rain puddle. Brashear much complex grounded, issues faces life crises, making part far challenging. This excellent recovery Gooding's last role `Chill Factor', film dreadful almost act professional suicide take part. After stint trying hand comedian (`Analyze This', `The Adventures Rocky & Bullwinkle', `Meet The Parents'), Robert DeNiro back dramatic roots outstanding performance. DeNiro bad comedian, great dramatic actor seems like waste time comedy. DeNiro endows Billy Sunday rock hard personality belying tortured soul. It pleasure watching work.  It seems every film I watch lately Charlize Theron it. I saw `The Legend Bagger Vance', `Men Honor' `The Yards' right row I beginning wonder part every film 2000 (actually, five). This minor role Theron, carried well managed stay DeNiro step step. David Keith, co-starred Richard Gere `Officer Gentleman', cameo here The DVD interesting special features, including reflections real Carl Brashear deleted scenes.

Kevin Kline good here, outshined Danny Glover and, especially, Steve Martin. I've never much like Martin style, great. I loved whole speech gave Kline near end Grand Canyon. The writing excellent. Larry Kasdan is, IMO, great dialogue writer, along ways Kevin Smith Quentin Tarantino. Here, formed several three-dimensional characters well thought storylines, messages give positive feel lives.

"Spider-Man opinion best superhero ever, game best superhero game ever. While may somewhat easy, play several times get costumes comic book covers, makes easy get game. It may seem hard control first, get hang it, web-slinging like Spider-Man himself. The bosses, like levels somewhat easy, fun. The first boss, Scorpion, incredibly easy beat, fans comic books know, Scorpion one Spider-Man's deadly villains. The second boss, Rhino, also easy. The 3rd boss Venom, opinion easiest boss game, definately be. The 4th boss Venom again. This time, little bit difficult beat still easy. The 5th boss Mysterio, I think funnest boss battle game. He also one harder bosses, again, still fairly easy. Next boss Carnage, is, guessed it, easy beat. But Carnage actually kind fun fight. 7th boss Doctor Octopus, like bosses easy, easy ones shield. The 8th final boss exclusive game, never comic book cartoon. I spoil played game, boss boss game easy. Took 4 5 tries beat others I beat first second tries. All all, good game. I gave 8 10. The reasons I give 9 10 get costumes comic book covers gets kind boring (getting stuff take though), accurate according comic books cartoon show, bosses easy, used Hobgoblin and/or Green Goblin boss, I think would fun battle someone flying around air! They use sequel game either! Well Green Goblin villain upcoming Spider-Man movie, hopefully make video game based movie.",1

Suspicious suspects abound, professor Parker solve mystery campus murderer becomes another statistic?  I'm precisely sure many versions movie available. The UK altered video released alias Campus Killings, US copy I states complete unedited edition, could mean censored print floating somewhere? I'd fairly surprised case Splatter University certainly gore-delicious hyperbole packaging would lead believe. One two litres corn syrup certainly stand gore hound's scrutiny compared likes Blood Rage Pieces, instance movie somewhat hyped. One thing many critics failed mention charming lead performance Francine Forbes, ends carrying entire picture shoulders throughout 79-minute running time. Despite amateurish direction Richard Haines still unveils magnificent potential lead chance another stab serious acting accomplished helmer. Unfortunately possibility never came, bottom barrel bombs like Death Ring Splitz certainly help nurture talent could improved dramatically right scholarship.

"The main problem I see film score, screams every note, ""This cheap-ass movie."" There's much say here. The score plain sucked. The second problem, I see quite severe well involves unwinding plot near end film (one money shots, will), dialogue Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) sunflower man (Richard Ziman), Martha revealed leader experiment. At times dialogue, viewer much aware s/he listening movie dialogue. In words, suspension disbelief breaks here. The integrity believable dialogue two people sacrificed willy-nilly stuffing information movie makers wish impart audience. The third problem casting Adrienne Barbeau. While I honestly believe fabulous actress within oeuvre, I feel part may much stretch. The main point performance seem mesh spectrum across character moves film loving mother troubled family almost Rambo-like woman mission. This aspect script would obviously stretch actress, one cannot place much blame, therefore, upon Barbeau. To degree fairly competently acted part, however, I would call moderately severe problem film whole. Finally, film wonderful job first half building creep factor, notably horror flashes. I feel film would benefited commitment flashes mechanism preventing fizzling creep factor second half movie. So what's holistic grading piece? I'd give solid C+ B-, depending upon much credit inclined give makers producing film limited budget. Even two severe two moderately severe problems, film premised solid plot Jungian side Nazi mysticism. I see problems plot development coherence; dialogue, noted exception above, downright brilliant places, especially important keystone scene mother daughter beginning movie; mentioned, creep factor well crafted, bit fizzly second half; Nicholas Brendan, also associated produced, delivered wonderful performance.

She's ""Stifler's Mom"". She's way sexier. I also digged Chris Jordan's Anna. Jordan looks sounds much like Elaine Joyce I thought might ""separated birth"" twin even Elaine herself. Anna always eating must incredible metabolism. Unlike 1990's soft-core porn, 70's softie porn retained hardcore film's realism (something 2000's soft-core brought back occasion, instead 90's music canned orgasms) full force. It's real feels real.

"ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two eager young sailors, Joe Brady (Gene Kelly) Clarence Doolittle/Brooklyn (Frank Sinatra), get special four-day shore leave. Eager get girls, particularly Joe's Lola, neither Joe Brooklyn figure interruption little Navy-mad Donald (Dean Stockwell) Aunt Susie (Kathryn Grayson). Unexperienced ways females courting, Brooklyn quickly enlists Joe help win Aunt Susie over. Along way, however, Joe finds falling gal thinks belongs best friend. How Brooklyn going take betrayal? And Joe end Susie, loves too? The first second times I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH, I also saw time I ON THE TOWN, Kelly/Sinatra collaboration 1949. Both times I felt ANCHORS AWEIGH better film terms plotting structure--all dances songs fit moment plot, develop characters story rather hamper them. Yet, times I came away feeling ON THE TOWN better film overall. Having seen films third time, I still stand judgement. Somehow ON THE TOWN, film piece entertainment, lighter, gayer, purely simply *happier*. The numbers outrageous less integral plot, yet somehow works better dances singing ANCHORS AWEIGH. I'm quite sure is. The typical argument latter film over-long: almost two half hours, certainly valid criticism make. I certainly felt length first two times I saw it! However, also film grows you--the see it, shorter feels appreciate technical mastery involved making. And yet, something hang together quite right. It feels almost script pored over, *every* single moment Kelly could break dance Sinatra song noted, that's exactly happened. No opportunity shoehorn musical number given up... that's probably film's biggest weakness. It 16 numbers (give take few), matter big fan Kelly Sinatra, really starts turn one numb while. (Contrast this, example, ten numbers ON THE TOWN.) You might well feel song, dance, can't taken film without leaving lacking... that's true. But that's also writers restrained adding first place. All long preamble mean there's nothing good ANCHORS AWEIGH. The musical *is* splashy great songs bursting over, like duets Kelly Sinatra ('We Hate To Leave', 'I Begged Her' 'If You Knew Susie'), singing Sinatra ('What Makes The Sunset', 'The Charm Of You', best all, 'I Fall In Love Too Easily'), without doubt always inventive, always breathtaking dancing Kelly. It's also hard miss cast calibre. Grayson sweet seems improve viewing (her voice becoming stunning rather frightening); Jose Iturbi's role written sympathetically great job it; even Clarence's Brooklyn, Pamela Britton, cute charming... close one could get Betty Garrett without Garrett herself! Sinatra adorable blue eyes curls his, plays innocent boy-man wonderfully (a role reprises ON THE TOWN). His singing is, usual, simply faultless enunciation timing phrasing. His solo numbers might seem drag little, got voice century, showcasing probably good reason slow rest film! Gene Kelly's sheer genius film worthy paragraph. Third billing behind Sinatra Grayson respectively, ANCHORS AWEIGH really Kelly's film. His Joe Brady believable, real character--he's tough outside, glib willing lie necessary win gal, he's actually biggest softy inside. Kelly makes charming rather cloying, also gives Joe real edge see scene Joe chases Brooklyn around room genuinely murderous look face breakfast tray hands. And *dancing*--again, film suffers 'too much good thing spoils effect' syndrome, Sinatra's singing. But again, Gene Kelly softshoe, tapping across screen sailor's outfit dressed bandit chief... might well err side overdoing it! All Kelly's dances breathtaking, pared-down simplicity tap number Sinatra 'I Begged Her', 'Mexican Hat Dance' sweet wide-eyed little girl, lavish Spanish-influenced dance 'La Cumparsita'. Of course, classic image left audiences' minds time would Kelly red, white blue sailor suit, dancing Jerry Mouse 'Tom & Jerry' fame. A well-deserved golden film memory, sure--it's often one say impressed special effects film made 1945, given saturation CGI contemporary film market. But Gene Jerry still look great, Kelly always hitting spots looking exactly needs look. It *would* turn people could really keep Gene Kelly would Kelly (in COVER GIRL) cartoon animation.  It's doubtless first daring, inventive Kelly dance Jerry reserved place ANCHORS AWEIGH film history hearts classic film buffs. But also notable first three Kelly/Sinatra film collaborations, though rather drawn-out, still great couple hours entertainment. Watch first, maybe again--it'll grow realise it! 7.5/10",1

"With release Peter Jackson's famed ""Lord Rings"" trilogy, even easier dismiss Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated Lord Rings film inferior. I agree majority Jackson's trilogy essential film adaptation Tolkien's work, prevent enjoying Bakshi's ambitious pioneering effort.

I part satisfied drawings characters. The pairs Pippin Merry Eowyn Galadriel mostly indistinguishable visually, Balrog Treebeard unimpressive, points bother much.

In addition hand-drawn characters, live actors incorporated animation rotoscoping. It quite apparent characters hand-drawn rotoscoped, none less I found film's style novelty.

Aragorn favorite character mine stories, backed John Hurt's voice favorite character adaptation. My favorite William Squire, whose voice appropriately strong Gandalf. The actor seemed inappropriate Michael Scholes Sam, whose voice acting irritating added Sam's unfortunately silly image. The bothersome part voice acting mispronunciation character place names. Particularly strange decision frequently Saruman referred ""Aruman"". In producing film, Ralph Bakshi expected ability produce two films. Hence, film contains half story, start ""The Fellowship Ring"" end battle Helm's Deep ""The Two Towers"". The obvious implication film's story highly condensed version story books. I enjoy original stories thorough adaptations, liberties taken compress story bother me, even choice leave Arwen story.

Apparently, filmmakers leave later years Page's life leave kind redemptive period, leaving behind photo shoots Jesus. In all, Notrious Bettie Page much kind usual bio-pic presented HBO films, albeit time stamina feature-film release.

You hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail, murder, one spot!  The lead actors credible job. And, I found intricately woven plot believable interesting. However, supporting cast, primarily bikers, delivers stilted performance, particularly asked deliver lines words. Perhaps used real bikers, instead actors. A couple characters, particular, exceptionally believable. The musical score absolutely spot-on, times, tempo, moving story forward. I found music real treat. I noticed opening credits movie featured music ""The Food,"" I googled them; but, find anything... In case, George E.

One jealous colleagues, insane daughter noted Doctor Wolfstein, knows condition reveals wife cheating him. But setup twisted scientific experiment unleash inner beast. ""Walterman"" flips out, turns werewolf, kills people, electrocuted, dies, buried, unburied, taken castle filled circus freaks, wired various machines, zapped assorted electronic effects, injected potent elixirs, chained up, turns werewolf, woman evening gown thigh-high Nazi fetish boots whips him, escapes, helps pretty female doctor find way castle, fends circus freaks battle axe, eventually turns back werewolf, fight death female werewolf incarnation cheating wife.

In one scene pouring rain wolfman howls lightning; next shot bone dry he's howling full moon. Then raining again. And yet look gaffe. Its like unfolding dream contradictions possible, opposites same, effects proceed causes; First wolfman picks power cable screams, cable starts sparking electricity. People say low budget hurts overall effectiveness -- I say film would unwatchable dime spend. It marvel making something nothing, succeeds could had, does. It's easy laugh stuff like even easier dismiss it. The trick able see mayhem, rather regard chaos part effect. Paul Naschy died last week age 75. He ill pancreatic cancer year more, working film projects right last days, passed away Madrid, Spain, family receiving chemotherapy treatment.

And yet us eleven year old kid watch movies like ""Fury Wolfman"" rapt awe. Even people like Euro Horror discover something movie marvel at, minute couple spots. You find free Archive.Org even buy DVD nickel. It's worth far, far more. Amusingly, Naschy horrified learn many others like regard twisted, sick, demented little movie classic, outright masterpiece Cinema Dementia. The problems encountered production mess film left perhaps personal artistic disappointment Naschy forgive. I would never presume dare forgive him, I say this: I'd rather watch ""Fury Wolfman"" dingiest, cut degraded fullscreen public domain print ever sit though overbearing, obnoxious crap churning Swine Flu cineplexes weekend. The world lost great artist month. Watch films, remember. 9/10",1

As Philip, Leslie Howard excellent. His wan, somewhat wilted good looks perfect failed aesthete. Nor impose personal interpretation part, as, say, Dirk Bogarde might done, gives work rare clarity.

I think captures spirit story well enough, Howard perfect Philip Carey. The sexual undercurrents muted, times Philip behaves masochistically absence strong sex feelings makes one wonder character's sanity, surely Mr. Maugham's intention.

Most characters portrays unstable temperament vulnerability burst moment. He might even typecast characters hidden anger problems.

"Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Even I knew film about, names enough draw in. Gorgeous, talented popular, performers look for. Ok, I start. We already know film about. Five beautiful girls targeted 'romantic' serial slasher, guy turned school dance 13 years ago. His trademarks include subtle deaththreats disguised valentine cards, maggot-infested chocolates bleeding nose. His weapon choice: well, take pick - axe, knife, electric powerdrill, bow arrow, hot iron, etc. Ok, basically horror movie nice twisted sense sexuality. Horror movies supposed Shakespeare, I'm gonna go there. I love horror movies, them. This one, I adore. It's favorites. It's funny, sexy scary. The killer's mask childishly creepy, seeing cupid firing bow arrow victim really freaky. The acting topnotch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton David Boreanaz lot fun. I really wish see much, much Katherine Heigl. I one biggest fans would love see leading work soon. Jessica Capshaw capable actress, Jessica Cauffiel gets ditzy blonde role perfected Urban Legend 2. The smaller parts also good; Hedy Buress hoot ('bleedmedry.com') younger version Denise Richards looked frightfully like her. Highlights: Every death scene particular distinction it. The creepiest opening scene morgue. The hottub scene, ludicrous, well done. And audiovisual maze sinister. The soundtrack great, creepy music fine alternative tunes. Lowpoint: I felt though killer featured enough, barely saw mask, featured climax. I also thought climax really unfocused, fun nonetheless. The twist end big surprise, I'm really glad filmmakers decided spare us whole 'explaining killer' routine. I like tell people movies see, someone asked pick horror movie I thought really worth seeing, Valentine would it. My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)",1

This game ranks far. I honor playing mine PS2 graphics really good. The voice acting standard. The difficulty level right. Wesker best characters RE series opinion. The story amazed took many different twist I expecting. The rating game deserves great.,1

"First love desperately difficult subject pull convincingly cinema : all-encompassing passion involved generally ends pale imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous. Lifshitz manages avoid pitfalls delivers moving, sexy, thoroughly engrossing tale love, disaster possible redemption, tangentially touching deeper themes human existence. The core story Mathieu, 18, solitary, introverted boy meets C├⌐dric, brasher, outgoing lonely, holiday family. As summer warms on, fall love and, holidays end, decide live together. A year later, relationship ends catastrophe: C├⌐dric cheats Mathieu who, distraught, tries take life. He survives and, order get perspective back life returns seaside town first met, time cloaked chill winter. If tale told like would never impact does: much implied, happens non-sequentially. The intricate narrative essential getting deeper feeling passions experienced, use counterpoint temporal perspective. Fortunately, three time-lines used (the summer love, post-suicide psychiatric hospital winter reconstruction) colour coded: warm yellows oranges summer, almost frighteningly chill blue hospital scenes warming browns blues winter seaside. Both main actors put excellent performances though, whilst delight see St├⌐phane Rideau (C├⌐dric) used full capacity (I'm used seeing under-stretched Gael Morel's rather limp dramas), J├⌐r├⌐mie Elkaim (Mathieu) singled special mention: feel loneliness, almost incredulous passion, character crumbling behind wall aphasia. Beautifully crafted gestures get across far dialogue ever could. The themes touched upon almost classic French cinema: difficulty really understanding another feeling; difficulty communicating fully; shifting sands meaning┬à The film's title ""Presque rien"" (Almost Nothing) points and, indeed, one key scenes film: In trying understand Mathieu attempted kill himself, psychiatrist asks C├⌐dric ever cheated him┬à ""Non┬à enfin, oui┬à une fois, mais ce n'├⌐tait rien"" (No┬à well, yes┬à once, nothing). C├⌐dric still loves Mathieu ┬û brought hospital suicide attempt (none see) tries desperately contact leaves ┬û cannot understand lost forever, something seemed nothing (a meaningless affair) everything Mathieu. Whilst film darker rather unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster would suggest, without hope: get see C├⌐dric's slow, painful attempts get back touch life, first cat adopts, work local bar finally contact Pierre, may next love.

"TACHIGUI: THE AMAZING LIVES OF THE FAST-FOOD GRIFTERS Japanese title: Tachiguishi Retsuden Director: Mamoru Oshii Featuring: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Narrated Koichi Yamadera ---------------------------------------- Way back 1995, Mamoru Oshii unleashed dazzling animation feature Ghost In The Shell, helped consolidate anime's international acceptance - also burrowed Andy Larry Wachowski's overall concept The Matrix. The movie's sequel, Innocence (2004), inaugural Japanese animated film compete Palme d'Or Cannes, left heads spinning much style innovative effects oft unfathomable plot. Always trendsetter, Oshii presented us Tachigui: The Amazing Lives Of The Fast-Food Grifters ┬û absolutely nothing Ghost In The Shell, Japanese anime matter. Say hello Oshii's creation ""superlivemation"": quite animation, exactly live-action. Instead cast endured somewhere vicinity 30,000 snapshots, digitally processed reconstituted deceptively simple paper cut-out fashion reminiscent Balinese puppetry. The movement stilted, stop-motion style echoes sequences Shinya Tsukamoto's experimental Tetsuo: Iron Man (1988). ""I think method one,"" said Oshii recent interview The Daily Yomiuri. ""I realized project suitable traditional animation."" The cast choice equally enigmatic. Kenji Kawai - also composed superlative soundtrack - appears ravenous burger fanatic, renowned Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki spends screen time murdered bizarre fashion. Others include Katsuya Terada, dabbled Oshii Blood: The Last Vampire, Shinji Higuchi - special effects whiz who's worked Godzilla movies. Koichi Yamadera's narration sounds like stuff dry NHK documentary ┬û belies comic undertone well Yamadera's extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like Spike Siegel Cowboy Bebop. And plot bizarre re-imagining post-WWII Japan context various fast-food off-shoots - soba ramen shops gyudon stand-up bars; American dogs heat-up trays convenience stores McDonalds- inspired burger-chain restaurants. ""Food primal root desire,"" asserted Oshii, way explanation.  Thrown mix new breed consumer: fast-food grifters title, people like pay tucker constantly fine-tuning elaborate scams score free munchies.  Oshii said ulterior motive homage ""art"" eating food streets ┬û something still considered bit taboo country, goes way toward explaining use ""tachigui"" title. The director live-action movies (Avalon, Stray Dog) well animation, Oshii often blurred definition two mediums. The celluloid result deposited somewhere grey area formats. At times visual experiment exhilarating irritating. Just ask really supposed mean; Oshii's films, equal parts cerebral innovative, often particularly clear story-wise. Where Oshii succeeds via liberal dose black humor ┬û find Kentucky Fried Rat, death hula-hoop, world's fastest samurai burger chef ┬û movie's nature surrealism. This man defers influence filmmakers like Godard Truffaut, perhaps owes much Andrei Tarkovsky David Lynch. So come surprise one stage B-52 bomber fly- Yoshinoya look-alike franchise.

"I thought original film quaint charming well sitting edge seat trying figure out. Since I already seen original, I saw Sci Fi Channel- I know remake deliberately made Sci Fi - I knew within first minutes. Since I like Richard Burgi character actor, I wanted see would pull off.

Maybe added bit polish film, not. This film. Film? This production takes sinister edge original did- The original ended confrontation young woman alien understanding sorts took place, although resolution Alien's problem. I sort remember remake, woman became rather hostile towards Burgi/Alien- I think could ended better. But ending ending, yarn swell yarn, basic 1958 Science Fiction Pulp Stock. Many great science fiction stories written 50's even made film. This swell thing watch like rainy day something. I rate highly cos remakes old 50's Sci Fi, one came well. I actually enjoyed quite bit. But anyone really wants see story told WELL, I suggest original 1958 version Tom Tyron Gloria Talbott, directed Gene Fowler Jr.",1
